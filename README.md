# Machine_Design_formulae
This is a random collection of scripts that perform laborious calculations for certain Machine design problems

Notch sensitivity deals and aids in calculating the corrected stress concentration factor for a fully  corrected endurance limit

Material stiffness has to do with the stiffness of the materials clamped by a bolt loaded in tension(not fully complete and i'd appreciate any contributions)

Surface factor calculates the surface factor value which is one of the factors used in calculating the fully corrected endurance limit
