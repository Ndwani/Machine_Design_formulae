# Machine_Design_formulas
This is a random collection of scripts that perform laborious calculations for certain Machine design problems
Notch sensitivity deals aids in calculating the corrected stress concentration factor for a corrected endurance limit
Material stiffness has to do with the stiffness of the materials clamped by a bolt loaded in tension(not fully complete and i'd appreciate any contributions)
Surface factor calculate its value and is one of the factors used in calculating the corrected endurance limit
